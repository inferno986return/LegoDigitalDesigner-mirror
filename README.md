Mirror of the Lego Digital Designer 4.3.10 installers + user manual + archive of my own LXF files

LEGO have announced they will finally be killing Lego Digital Designer (LDD), their famous CAD program that allows anyone to build LEGO models on their computer. This doesn't surprise me and I always questioned the future of LDD when they removed Pick-a-Brick which allowed you to order the models you made.

I have great nostalgia for this software and want to preserve a few models I have floating on my Google Drive. EU-based LEGO fan forum Eurobricks has a brilliant thread encouraging users to upload retail models made in LDD, several of these models are from that. *I do not own Lego Digital Designer and all rights (to my best knowledge) belong to the LEGO Group.*

I also archived the (download page)[https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd] on (archive.today)[https://archive.fo/rQ6E2].

LEGO purchased BrickLink and now (BrickLink Studio)[https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page] is deemed the successor to LDD. I plan on trying it, particularly when the tagline is "FEEL THE DIFFERENCE".

## Only offline mode is supported in LDD 4.3

>If you proceed to download and use LDD version 4.3.10 you will experience errors when launching the application. You can still use "offline" mode if you wish.

## Official minimum system requirements

The official minimum system requirements as taken from the LDD download page. Reportedly high RAM is required for particularly large models.
